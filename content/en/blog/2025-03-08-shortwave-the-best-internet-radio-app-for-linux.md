# Shortwave – The Best Internet Radio App for Linux

Internet radio is an underrated source of music discovery. While Spotify and co. keep you in your bubble, radio stations introduce **new artists and genres** you would otherwise never find.

**Shortwave** is the best app for this on Linux.

## What is Shortwave?

Shortwave allows you to stream radio stations from all over the world and offers the ability to record and save individual songs.

### Technical Background

- **Based on libadwaita** (native GNOME integration)
- **Written in Rust** (modern, secure, performant)
- **Available as a Flatpak** (officially via Flathub)
- **Supports AMD64 and ARM**

### Installation

**Flatpak (recommended):**
```bash
flatpak install flathub de.haeckerfelix.Shortwave
```

**Snap:**
```bash
sudo snap install shortwave
```

The Flatpak version is recommended if you want the latest GNOME Background App API features.

## How to Listen to Radio with Shortwave?

When you start the app, you see a minimalist interface. A **"+"** icon in the top left allows you to add stations.

### Searching for Stations

The search function is comprehensive:
- Not just major stations
- Also niche and local stations
- Worldwide coverage

### Station Information

For each station, you can see:
- Country of origin
- Transmission codec
- Current program

With **"Add to Library"**, you can save stations permanently.

### Manual Adding

Via the dropdown menu next to the **"+"** icon, you can also add stations manually if they don't appear in the search.

## Recording Radio with Shortwave

Shortwave automatically caches all played tracks and displays them in a list on the right.

### Saving Individual Songs

With the small arrow icon, you can save a song permanently.

### Automatic Saving

In the settings, you can enable **automatic saving**. Then all tracks will be saved – but this takes up storage space!

## Why Radio in the Age of Streaming?

Music streaming services like Spotify offer algorithmic recommendations – but they keep you in your **comfort zone**.

Internet radio brings you:
- New artists you would never search for
- Genres you don't know
- Random discoveries that become favorites

**Radio is a valuable addition to streaming services**, not their replacement.

## Conclusion

Shortwave is a **perfect GNOME app**:
- Native integration
- Clean, uncluttered design
- Solid features without bloat
- Written in Rust (modern and secure)

### Who is Shortwave for?

✅ **You should use Shortwave if:**
- You use GNOME
- You want to discover new music
- You want to listen to radio stations from all over the world
- You occasionally want to record songs

❌ **You don't need it if:**
- You only use Spotify/YouTube Music
- You have no interest in radio

**My conclusion:** Shortwave is the best internet radio app for Linux. If you use GNOME, it's a must-have.
