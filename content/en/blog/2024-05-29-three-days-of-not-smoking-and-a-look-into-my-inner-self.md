As I write these lines, I have been smoke-free for almost exactly 72 hours. And yes, 3 days doesn't sound like much, and people who have never smoked will not really be able to understand the achievement behind it. But for me, it is a first big step towards freedom and health.

These first days without cigarettes were a real challenge. The physical withdrawal is noticeable: headaches, inner restlessness and the constant craving for nicotine.

Smoking was my companion for a long time in stressful situations, in moments of boredom, as a social ritual, for relaxation. The wonder drug nicotine helped me in all situations.

Smoking was a firm part of my everyday life. But now, after 72 hours without a cigarette, I am beginning to become aware of these moments and to question them. Why do I reach for a cigarette in certain situations? What is really behind it?

## Day 0: Sunday evening

On Sunday evening, I consciously smoked my last cigarette. It was a moment of reflection and farewell. After that, I not only emptied and cleaned the ashtray, but threw it away completely. It was a symbolic act that helped me to consolidate my decision to stop smoking.

## Day 1: Monday

On Monday, I was surprisingly well. I felt determined and optimistic. For the critical moments with strong cravings, I had a nicotine spray at hand, which reliably helped to reduce the craving for a cigarette.

I began to notice the first changes - what struck me most was the freedom of not having to constantly go outside to smoke.

## Day 2: Tuesday

On Tuesday, I noticed the first physical side effects. Which show once again that nicotine is a drug and that withdrawal from it is not totally easy.

Headaches and a general malaise set in, accompanied by psychological irritability. I felt tense and nervous, as if my body and mind were rebelling against the withdrawal. Nevertheless, I held on, supported by small positive reinforcements, such as the idea of a freer life.

## Day 3: Wednesday

Today, on Wednesday, the physical symptoms were the worst. Sweating, uncontrolled shaking and even stronger headaches gave me a hard time.

In addition, there were massive concentration problems and difficulties focusing on my work. In addition, I was constantly tired (although I had slept enough). It was as if my body was using all its reserves to compensate for the lack of nicotine.

Despite these challenges, I held on, motivated by the thought that every day without a cigarette brings me closer to a better self.

## A look into my inner self

During these days, I have begun to deal intensively with my inner self. There are several voices in my head, not only when smoking, but always. I often debate with myself whether I should say yes or no to a decision, go through the pros and cons and question my motives.

I have now begun to see the inner self that occasionally urges me to smoke a cigarette as a separate personality. I imagine this voice as a separate being and reject it directly.

For example, after a delicious meal, when the craving for a cigarette is particularly strong, I think to myself: "You dirty bastard, it's clear that you want to take advantage of this situation - but no, thanks."

Either these dialogues show that I urgently need psychiatric help. More importantly, however, this dialogue with myself helps me to maintain control and consciously say no.

It gives me the feeling that I am not helpless, but can actively make decisions that serve my well-being. This inner confrontation is an important part of my process of understanding myself better and recognizing my needs more clearly.

Of course, there are still moments of weakness when the temptation is great. But every time I resist, I feel stronger and more motivated. These three days are the beginning of a journey that will not only make me physically healthier, but can also lead to a better understanding of myself.

I know that the road will still be long and rocky, but I am ready to walk it. These first 72 hours have shown me that I have the strength to change my habits and lead a freer life.
