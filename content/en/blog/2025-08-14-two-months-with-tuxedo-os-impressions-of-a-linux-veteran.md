# Two Months with TUXEDO OS – Impressions of a Linux Veteran

I have been a Linux user for years. But for this test, I deliberately took the **beginner's perspective**. For two months, I used TUXEDO OS on an **HP EliteBook** as my daily driver.

## Installation & Setup

The **Calamares installer** guides you cleanly through the installation without being overwhelming. Particularly good: You can already choose between **X11** and **Wayland** during the installation – this shows that TUXEDO has both traditional and modern users in mind.

## WebFAI System

TUXEDO offers **WebFAI**, a tool for automated factory installation. This works cross-platform and provides a real safety net:

- Reset the system to factory settings
- Reinstall without data loss
- Practical alternative to complete reinstallations

For beginners, this is **worth its weight in gold**.

## KDE Plasma out-of-the-box

**TUXEDO has configured the default settings so that you can be productive immediately.**

No hours of adjusting ten settings at once. The system feels modern and responsive without having to tweak it first.

## TUXEDO Control Center

This is the **killer feature**. Not a cosmetic interface, but real hardware integration:

✅ Adjust fan curves
✅ Switch CPU profiles
✅ Control keyboard backlighting
✅ Battery management (charging limit at 80%)

This is **real engineering**, not just a pretty UI.

## A small annoyance: Energy Management

TUXEDO uses its own power management instead of the standard `power-profiles-daemon`. This leads to a **"not supported"** warning in the battery widget.

Functionally, everything is fine, but it's confusing for beginners. TUXEDO should improve this.

## Update Model

The hybrid release model balances:

- **Continuous software updates**
- **Stable base**
- **No aggressive rolling release**

This is just right for productive systems.

## Usability Challenges with KDE

As a long-time GNOME user, I noticed a few integration gaps:

### 1Password
Does not automatically detect sleep states. You have to unlock it again after waking up.

### Virtual Desktops
Empty workspaces are not automatically removed. GNOME does this better.

### GPG Key Integration
The integration with the system keyring does not work properly. I had to **completely remove GPG key passphrases** to work reasonably.

This is a **security compromise** I had to make.

## Conclusion

TUXEDO OS feels like a **finished product** – curated, technically solid, with a clear focus on everyday usability.

### What's good
✅ Installation and setup
✅ TUXEDO Control Center (hardware integration)
✅ Sensible KDE default settings
✅ Low-maintenance and reliable

### What could be better
⚠️ Energy management warning confuses beginners
⚠️ KDE integration has gaps (1Password, GPG)

### Who is TUXEDO OS for?

**You should use TUXEDO OS if:**
- You want a reliable, low-maintenance system
- You like KDE Plasma but don't want to tweak it
- You want to buy TUXEDO hardware

**You should use something else if:**
- You prefer GNOME
- You want a rolling release (then use Arch/Fedora)
- You need maximum customizability

**My plan:** I will buy TUXEDO hardware at the end of 2025. The system has convinced me.
