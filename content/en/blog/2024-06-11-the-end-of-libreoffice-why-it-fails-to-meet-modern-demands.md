About 9 months ago, I interpreted the release notes of LibreOffice 7.6.0 to mean that the LibreOffice developers and the foundation behind it have largely given up on the product.

And I speculated that LibreOffice would be put into a kind of "maintenance mode" and there would only be bug fix updates. [To the blog post at the time.](https://rueegger.me/2023/09/02/das-ende-von-libreoffice/)

9 months later, it's time to check this prediction.

## Quick conclusion first:

Yes, I was right. With version 24.2 (new version scheme), the biggest "change" is that the document recovery (which has existed since OpenOffice times) is now automatically active and does not have to be activated by the user first. A basic setting that, by the way, has been handled this way by most Linux distributions for years.

Version 24.8 will be released in August. The most important new feature for LibreOffice Writer listed here is that you can now change the width of a comment field.

Any hint of the integration of a generative AI? Nope. Collaborative work? Nope. Can you finally install LibreOffice on a smartphone or tablet? Nope.

If someone says in the future that the blame for the downfall of LibreOffice lies with Microsoft, Google or someone else. No! LibreOffice has brought this entirely upon itself.

## Collaborative Work

Google was a pioneer here. In 2006, Google released its Google Docs. A small office that runs completely in the browser. With the most important feature of all: you could work on a document together with several people at the same time.

Do you still remember the old days when documents were sent back and forth by e-mail? And in the end you had 17, 18 or more versions because every person had added something somewhere? And someone from the group then had to sift through all versions of the document at the end and merge the changes by hand.

Google changed the world in 2006 with collaborative work. I used it back then in my training for group work, etc., because it was just so useful, simple and brilliant.

Here, Microsoft in particular noticed how much they were lagging behind with their market leader product - Microsoft Office. And it quickly became apparent that this collaborative work was not just a nice gimmick, but was directly adapted by the economy.

Several large companies (companies that are among the 300 largest stock-listed companies in the world) have turned their backs on Microsoft Office and switched to Google. A prominent example here is "LafargeHolcim AG", which have converted 70,000 jobs in 70 countries around the world. Or Roche Holding AG - the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, which have also switched to it.

It was quickly noticed that Microsoft was caught on the wrong foot here. They definitely did not have collaborative work on their radar and it took another 7 years (2013) until Microsoft Office also mastered this function. In 2016, Apple followed suit with their iWork and has supported collaborative work ever since.

Today, in 2024, this function is "completely normal" and present in almost every office suite. At LibreOffice, this function is not even on the "is planned" list.

## Device-independent work

Out of the office, onto the train and finally home. Hardly on the way, you see an e-mail from a work colleague on your smartphone. She asks if I could take a quick look at a presentation that she has just finished and has to present tomorrow.

Sure, no problem, open the document directly on the smartphone. Look through the slides, leave a few comments and support the work colleague during the train ride. a task that is very everyday and also quite normal.

But impossible with LibreOffice. Even in 2024 (!) there is no LibreOffice in the Apple App or Google Play Store for either smartphones or tablets. That's just stupid. Most people today spend more time with their smartphone than with a desktop computer. And contrary to all clichÃ©s, people also spend a lot of productive time with their mobile companions.

Firefox made the same mistake back then and it cost them a massive amount of market share. When smartphones as we know them today conquered the world in 2007/2008, Mozilla saw no reason to release their browser for smartphones as well.

The point is, if you suddenly use Google Chrome on your smartphone, you will sooner or later do so on all other devices as well - because the synchronization of data is a good plus point.

Around 2007, Firefox still had a worldwide market share of over 70%, since then it has only fallen piece by piece. Today it is around 3%. What would the market share look like if Firefox had not appeared until 2011 (Android) or 2016 (9 years after the first iPhone...)?

LibreOffice has learned nothing from the Firefox debacle to this day and remains an office only for desktop computers. But the point here is the same as with Firefox. If I get used to Google Docs or Microsoft Office on my smartphone, for example, I will then also use these products on my desktop computer.

## AI Integration

Since last year, AI has become indispensable. And if you just look at the progress of AI in the last year, you quickly realize that the way we operate computers and use programs will change massively.

And yes: AI is also a very big topic in Office. At Google Docs, you can already activate AI. Microsoft has now built their CoPilot into everything from Paint to Excel. Apple announced yesterday that it will integrate the first commercial "Privacy AI" into all its products. Even small companies like SoftMaker Office have had an AI integrated in their latest version for months.

At LibreOffice? There are not even plans to work on something like that. The topic simply does not exist there. And this circumstance is probably one of the last nails to be hammered into the coffin of LibreOffice.

## Conclusion

LibreOffice has simply slept through all new "Office" developments. And even years later has not incorporated them. It is an office that basically still operates as an office operated in the 90s.

The problem is, the working world and also the world of the average user has not stood still in the 90s. For existing and conservative users, this will continue to be more than good enough. But the project will hardly be able to win new users with all the missing functions.

**Small detail: I wrote the text with Apple Pages. Not because I think iWork is a good office, but because I wanted to see how Apple Pages has changed in recent years ðŸ˜‰*
