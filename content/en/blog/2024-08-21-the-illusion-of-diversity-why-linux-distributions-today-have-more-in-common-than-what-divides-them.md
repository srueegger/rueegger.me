Linux users are proud of the sheer endless variety of distributions that offer a solution for almost every use case. Whether for the desktop, the server, embedded systems, or special niche applications – there is a suitable distribution for every taste and every requirement. But on closer inspection, it turns out that this diversity is often only superficial. While there are countless distributions, they share the same basic components at their core. So are we really dealing with true diversity, or just an illusion of choice?

## A huge selection of distributions

There's no denying it: the number of Linux distributions is overwhelming. From the big names like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux to specialized distributions like Kali Linux for security experts or Raspbian for the Raspberry Pi – the selection is almost unlimited. This diversity seemingly offers endless possibilities to find the perfect operating system for one's own needs.

## Uniform core components

Despite this external diversity, most of these distributions are based on the same basic building blocks. Almost all modern distributions use the Linux kernel, which forms the central component of the operating system. In addition, there are the GNU tools, which provide basic functionalities such as file system management and user administration. The init system, which is used when starting the system, is also Systemd in most cases, which has established itself as the standard in recent years. Wayland or X11 ensure the display of the graphical interface, and even with the package managers, many distributions are dependent on either RPM or DEB.

This dominance of a few technologies means that many distributions are very similar under the hood, even if they offer different goals and user experiences on the outside. The real difference between the distributions often only consists in the choice of the desktop environment, the preset applications, or the philosophy of package management.

## Was the diversity greater in the past?

If we look back into the past, the world of Linux distributions was actually more diverse. Different kernels (like Linux and BSD) were available, and there was a variety of init systems, including SysVinit, Upstart, and OpenRC. There were also greater differences in the package managers, which were not only reflected in the file formatting, but also in the basic way in which software was installed and updated.

However, this diversity often led to problems with compatibility and maintenance. Different init systems brought with them different configuration methods, and different kernels led to a fragmentation of driver and software support. Standardization through technologies like Systemd and the Linux kernel has solved many of these problems, but at the cost of diversity.

## Standardization: curse and blessing

Today's standardization has many advantages. It facilitates maintenance, improves compatibility, and ensures that developers can rely on a stable and widely used basis. Systemd, although it was heavily criticized at the beginning, has prevailed because it has eliminated many previous weaknesses. But this standardization also has a downside: it has led to many distributions losing their uniqueness. If almost all distributions are based on the same core components, what is left that really distinguishes them from each other?

## Are there real alternatives?

However, it would be wrong to claim that there are no real alternatives. Niche distributions like Void Linux, which relies on the Runit init system, or Guix System, which takes a radically different approach to system management, show that there is still room for innovation. However, these distributions are aimed at a very small target group and often require special expertise to be used effectively.

## Conclusion: Diversity or pseudo-diversity?

It is true that we have a larger number of Linux distributions today than ever before. But on closer inspection, it turns out that this diversity is often only superficial. The standardization on a few central technologies has led to a unification that minimizes the differences between the distributions. What remains are mostly different surfaces and approaches, but they are all based on the same foundations.

For most users, this may not be a disadvantage – on the contrary, it ensures a more stable and compatible Linux world. But those who are looking for real alternatives have to dig deeper and get involved with niche distributions that deliberately oppose the mainstream.

And the path is clear, there will be further standardization. We are in the middle of the Wayland transition. And also with the package managers, it is becoming apparent that Flatpak will win the race and become the universal cross-distribution application management.

I personally find this "pseudo-diversity" very unfortunate and often ask myself why distribution XY even exists. And I also fear that Linux will lose some of its innovative power piece by piece. On the positive side, I haven't been distro-hopping for years.

Whether Ubuntu, Fedora, openSuse, etc. in the end it's always the same anyway - so why switch?
