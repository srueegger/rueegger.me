# Proton Lumo in Comparison with ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Mistral

Proton, known for ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, has launched a new AI chatbot called **Lumo**. The promise: **end-to-end encryption** and **no use of your data for training**.

But how good is Lumo really? I tested it against the established competition.

## Test Setup

I conducted **identical tests** on all platforms, all with paid subscriptions:

- **ChatGPT:** GPT-5 model
- **Gemini:** 2.5 Pro model
- **Perplexity:** Auto-selection mode
- **Mistral:** Standard model
- **Lumo:** Standard model with automatic selection

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Response quality
- Depth and style
- Practical utility

## Test 1: Linux Questions

### Question: "What is the difference between apt and dnf?"

**Result:**
- All chatbots knew the answer
- **Lumo** showed outdated references (e.g., `apt-get` instead of `apt`)
- **Gemini** and **Mistral** provided clear comparison tables

**Conclusion:** Lumo works, but the knowledge base seems not entirely up-to-date.

### Question: "How do I install Podman?"

**Result:**
- All chatbots provided correct commands
- **ChatGPT** offered automation suggestions
- **Lumo** gave solid but unspectacular answers

## Test 2: Troubleshooting

### Question: "My USB stick is not being recognized. What should I do?"

**Result:**
- All chatbots recommended logical diagnostic steps
- **Gemini** offered structured formatting
- **Lumo** was neat, but without extras

## Test 3: Cultural and Historical Knowledge

### Question: "What was the GNOME 3 controversy?"

**Result:**
- All chatbots understood the context
- All mentioned the desktop forks (MATE, Cinnamon)
- **Lumo** was on par with the competition here

## Test 4: Regional Specifics (Switzerland)

### Question: "What is TWINT?"

**Result:**
- All recognized the Swiss payment system
- **ChatGPT** mentioned outdated Bluetooth beacons (discontinued in 2021)
- **Lumo** lacked information about prepaid functions

**Conclusion:** Regional context is understood, but the level of detail varies.

## Test 5: Creative Writing

### Task: "Write a funny social media post about the summer heat in Basel"

**Result:**
- All showed local knowledge (swimming in the Rhine)
- Humor was generally weak
- **Gemini** offered several format options and image suggestions

**Conclusion:** Creativity is still a work in progress for all of them.

## Test 6: Child-Friendly Explanations

### Question: "Explain cloud computing to a 6-year-old child"

**Result:**
- All used good analogies (toy boxes, treasure chests)
- Age-appropriateness was good for all
- **Lumo** was inconspicuously good here

## Summary: Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths (all platforms)
✅ Linux expertise consistently reliable
✅ Practical problem-solving solid
✅ Historical context correct

### Lumo-Specific Observations
⚠️ Outdated knowledge base in some answers
⚠️ Missing feature information (e.g., TWINT prepaid)
⚠️ Neat, but unspectacular

### Competitor Advantages
- **Gemini:** Structured formatting, multiple options
- **ChatGPT:** Practical automation, detailed customizations
- **Perplexity:** Precise, direct answers with sources
- **Mistral:** Clear feature comparisons, good user engagement

## Conclusion

**Proton Lumo is a solid but unspectacular AI alternative with a focus on data protection.**

### Who is Lumo for?

✅ **You should use Lumo if:**
- Data protection is more important to you than perfection
- You want end-to-end encryption
- You are already in the Proton ecosystem

❌ **You should use the competition if:**
- You want the best answers
- Up-to-date information is important to you
- You need advanced features (image generation, code debugging)

**My personal conclusion:**
Lumo is good for everyday questions, but not yet on the level of ChatGPT or Gemini. The data protection is a real advantage – but you pay for it with less sophistication.

If you want **privacy**, take Lumo. If you want **performance**, stick with ChatGPT.
