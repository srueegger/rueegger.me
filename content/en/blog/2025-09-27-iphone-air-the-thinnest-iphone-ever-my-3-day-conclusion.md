# iPhone Air: The Thinnest iPhone Ever – My 3-Day Conclusion

This is not a technical spec sheet comparison, but a personal experience report. I had three days to test the iPhone Air and its accessories in everyday life.

## What I Tested

- **iPhone Air 256GB White**: 999 CHF / 1,199 €
- **iPhone Air MagSafe Battery**: 99 CHF / 115 €
- **iPhone Air Bumper Light Gray**: 39 CHF / 45 €
- **Crossbody Band**: 59 CHF / 69 €

## Design & Haptics

The iPhone Air feels **exceptionally thin** and light. The weight is very well distributed, you don't feel any imbalance. Interesting: The USB-C port is **not centered** – the distances to the top and bottom are different. It's noticeable, but not annoying.

The **titanium frame** is robust and prevents bending very well. The device feels high-quality in the hand.

## Display

The display is **great**:
- Excellent color calibration
- High brightness (perfect for outdoors)
- Very low minimum brightness (ideal for night)

No complaints about the screen.

## Audio System: The Big Compromise

This is where it gets problematic. The iPhone Air has **only the earpiece speaker**. The bottom stereo speaker has been removed.

**You notice it. And you really notice it.**

- Massive loss of volume
- Hardly any bass
- It gets distorted above 75% volume

Anyone who listens to a lot of music, watches videos, or consumes podcasts without headphones will be disappointed here.

## Battery: Okay, but not more

After three days of moderate use (calls, messaging, video conferences, music streaming, hotspot), there was **10-15% remaining charge** in the evening.

That's **okay**, but significantly weaker than previous models. Heavy users will need a power bank or the MagSafe battery.

## MagSafe Battery

The official MagSafe battery provides about **55% additional charge**. It is compact and adheres well to the device.

**But:** It **cannot reverse charge**. The 2021 MagSafe battery pack could still do that – it would be technically possible, but it was disabled. A pity.

## Accessories

### Bumper

The bumper protects the device without destroying the slim line. It is thin but sturdy. A clear recommendation if you don't want to completely hide the design.

### Crossbody Band

The crossbody band is **very trendy**. In cities with mobile payment, you see people without bags – just a phone around their neck. The iPhone Air is perfect for this: light, thin, comfortable to wear.

## Who is the iPhone Air for?

This is primarily a **Gen-Z device**. It is optimized for **portrait mode use**:
- TikTok
- Instagram Reels
- YouTube Shorts

The single speaker at the top makes sense when you hold the phone vertically. For landscape videos (YouTube, Netflix), it's bad.

## Purchase Recommendation

The iPhone Air is an **emotional purchase**, not a rational one.

### You should buy the iPhone 17 if:
- Camera quality is important to you
- You need good speakers
- You want a strong battery
- You are looking for the best value for money

### You can buy the iPhone Air if:
- Design and weight are more important to you than specs
- You mainly consume portrait content
- You see the device as a fashion statement
- You don't care about the higher price

## Conclusion

**The important thing is to be aware that you are technically buying a worse device for more money.**

The iPhone Air is beautiful, light, and thin. But it sacrifices camera, speakers, and battery for it. Those who can live with that – and put design above all else – will be happy.

Everyone else should go for the iPhone 17.
