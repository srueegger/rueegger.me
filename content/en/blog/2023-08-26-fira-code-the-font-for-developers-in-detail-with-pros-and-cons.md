Programmers spend hours writing the perfect code that is not only functional, but also well-organized and understandable. An often overlooked but crucial component of this process is the font. Enter: **Fira Code**.

## History of fonts for developers

Since the early days of computer programming, developers have been looking for ways to make their code more readable and understandable. The choice of the right font played a decisive role in this. In the early days of computers, the available fonts were often severely limited, typically due to the limited graphics capabilities of the machines.

Monospace fonts, where each character takes up the same amount of space, became the standard because they offered clarity and uniformity. Over time, as technology evolved, designers and developers began to create fonts specifically tailored to the needs of programmers to make the code not only readable, but also aesthetically pleasing.

```javascript
let foo = 1;
let bar = 2;

if( foo == 1 ) {
  console.log( 'Hello World!' );
}

if( bar >= 3 ) {
  console.log( 'Hello World!' );
}

if( foo != bar ) {
  console.log( 'Hello World!' ); 
}
```

*Example code in a monospace font*

This change in the importance of fonts in the developer field has paved the way for modern fonts like Fira Code.

## The story behind Fira Code

Fira Code is an extension of Fira Mono, a monospace font originally developed as part of the Fira Font Family project by Mozilla. Mozilla wanted a font that reflected their brand identity while also offering high readability on screens.

Fira Mono was the result, but it was Nikita Prokopov who took the next step and created Fira Code with a series of programming ligatures.

### The secret of ligatures

While traditional ligatures are used to solve typographical problems in printed text (e.g. overlapping letters), the ligatures in Fira Code are designed to improve the readability of the code. They take common character combinations like `===`, `!==`, `=>`, `->`, etc. and combine them into a single, more readable symbol.

```javascript
let foo = 1;
let bar = 2;

if( foo == 1 ) {
  console.log( 'Hello World!' );
}

if( bar >= 3 ) {
  console.log( 'Hello World!' );
}

if( foo != bar ) {
  console.log( 'Hello World!' ); 
}
```

### Advantages of Fira Code

- **Increased clarity:** By reducing clutter and presenting clear symbols, Fira Code can make error detection easier and speed up code review.
- **Modern design:** The aesthetic appeal of Fira Code can increase satisfaction when coding. After all, beautiful code can be motivating!
- **Wide support:** Since Fira Code is open source, it is constantly being updated and improved, and there is a large community that provides additional features and support.

### Disadvantages of Fira Code

- **Takes getting used to:** For developers who have been programming for many years without ligatures, the transition to Fira Code can be confusing at first. Some even find the ligatures distracting or unnecessary, especially when working with other developers who do not use ligatures.
- **Not universally supported:** Although Fira Code works in many modern development environments and text editors, there are still some platforms and tools that have problems with the correct display of ligatures. This can lead to inconsistencies when the code is viewed on different systems or in different editors.
- **Performance issues:** Some users have reported that text editors with ligatures enabled can run slightly slower, especially when working with large files. While this is not necessarily directly due to Fira Code, it can be a problem when using fonts with ligatures.

## Installing Fira Code

### Fira Code on Linux

Most Linux distributions (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux) have Fira Code in their package sources and can be installed normally via the corresponding package manager.

Alternatively, you can download the TTFs from [GitHub](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases) and install them manually.

### Fira Code on Mac OS

On Mac OS, you can install Fira Code via the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/index_en).

```zsh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code
```

### Fira Code on Windows

On Windows, you have to download the fonts manually from [GitHub](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases) and install the individual TTFs manually.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right tools - including the right font - can make the difference between an average and an exceptional programming experience. Fira Code goes beyond the conventional monospace design and offers features specifically tailored to the needs of programmers.

So if you're looking for a way to improve your coding experience, a switch to Fira Code might be just the thing for you!
