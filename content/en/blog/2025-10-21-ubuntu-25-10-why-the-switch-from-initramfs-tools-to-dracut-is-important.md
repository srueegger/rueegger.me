# Ubuntu 25.10: Why the Switch from initramfs-tools to dracut is Important

Imagine an orchestra preparing for a concert. Before the musicians play, the stage must be set: instruments set up, microphones tested, lighting adjusted. This is exactly how a computer's boot process works – and this is where **initramfs** comes in.

## What happens when you turn on a computer?

When you turn on your computer, the following happens:

1. The firmware (BIOS/UEFI) starts
2. The bootloader (e.g., GRUB) is loaded
3. The Linux kernel starts

But here's the problem: The kernel cannot yet access your hard drive or encrypted partitions. It first needs drivers, modules, and tools – and that's exactly what **initramfs** provides.

**initramfs** is a temporary mini-operating system that is loaded into RAM. It ensures that:
- Hard drive drivers are loaded
- Encrypted partitions can be unlocked
- The actual system partition is mounted

Once the real system is running, initramfs disappears from memory.

**Fun Fact:** Windows uses the `boot.wim` file for a similar purpose, while macOS uses `kernelcache`. Technically, Linux, Windows, and macOS do many things very similarly here.

## Why Ubuntu is now switching to dracut

Until now, Ubuntu used **initramfs-tools**. This is a collection of shell scripts that create the initramfs image. These scripts were reliable, but:

- Hard to maintain (many individual scripts)
- Inflexible with new hardware
- Complicated to debug

With **Ubuntu 25.10**, **dracut** is now being used. Dracut was originally developed for Fedora and is now the standard for many major distributions.

### What makes dracut better?

**Modular design:** Instead of rigid scripts, dracut uses reusable modules.

**Automatic detection:** Dracut automatically detects what your system needs and builds a customized, lean initramfs.

**Better maintainability:** Developers can update and extend modules more easily.

## What does this mean for me as a user?

### Concrete advantages

**Faster booting:** Dracut creates more efficient initramfs images, which can reduce boot time.

**More stable system:** Less script chaos means fewer potential sources of error.

**Better hardware support:** Modern devices (e.g., Bluetooth keyboards during the boot process) are better supported.

**Encrypted systems:** Modules are loaded earlier, which has advantages for encrypted hard drives.

### For developers and admins

**Clearer structure:** Modules instead of a mess of shell scripts.

**Easier debugging:** Boot problems can be diagnosed more easily.

## A bit of history

In the past, there was **initrd** (Initial RAM Disk) – a rigid RAM disk. This was inflexible and had to be manually adjusted.

**initramfs** (since Linux 2.6) is more dynamic: It is generated at boot time and adapts better to the environment.

**dracut** goes one step further: modular architecture, automatic detection, better maintainability.

## Where does dracut come from?

Dracut was developed in 2008 by the Fedora/Red Hat community. One of the main developers was the German developer **Harald Hoyer**.

The name? **Dracut** is a town in Massachusetts, USA. Red Hat has a tradition of naming projects after towns in New England.

Today, many major distributions use dracut:
- Fedora
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- openSUSE
- Gentoo
- Solus
- SUSE Enterprise Linux

With Ubuntu, another important distribution is now joining them.

## Conclusion

The switch from initramfs-tools to dracut is an important step for Ubuntu. It's not just about technical details, but about:

- **Modernizing** the boot process
- **Unifying** between different distributions
- **Better future-proofing**

For most users, the switch will be barely noticeable – but under the hood, Ubuntu is becoming more modern, stable, and future-proof.

**Important:** The switch to dracut only affects new installations of Ubuntu 25.10. Those who upgrade from 25.04 will continue to use initramfs-tools.
