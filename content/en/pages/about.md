# Hello! I'm Samuel üëã

Web Developer, AI-Nerd, and Open-Source Enthusiast from **Basel, Switzerland** üá®üá≠

## Terminal: whoami

```bash
$ whoami
Samuel R√ºegger

$ location
Basel, Switzerland - The most beautiful spot on the Rhine

$ current_status
Coding with Star Trek in the background, LCARS interface on screen
```

## The Human Behind the Terminal

I live in **Basel** ‚Äì the city where people jump into the **Rhine** in summer and float downstream. With my **Wickelfisch**, I regularly jump into the cool water and drift comfortably downstream. That's pure quality of life! üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Fun Fact**: I'm someone who genuinely gets excited when a new `git commit` goes through, who stares at `diff` output longer than most movies, and who pays more attention to the LCARS interface in "Star Trek: The Next Generation" than to the plot. Yes, I'm a **nerd** ‚Äì and proud of it! üññ

## What I Do (Professionally)

For over a decade, I've been navigating the world of **web development**. What started as a hobby became a passion and then a career. I love solving complex problems with elegant technical solutions.

**My Specialties:**

- **Full-Stack Development**: From database to UI ‚Äì I speak both languages
- **AI Integration**: Embedding LLMs in web applications? Challenge accepted!
- **Performance Optimization**: Slow websites are like slow terminals ‚Äì unacceptable
- **Open Source**: Sharing code, strengthening community, improving together

**Current Project:** I'm actively involved with **[GuideOS](https://guideos.de)** ‚Äì an innovative open-source project that revolutionizes how we work with operating systems and development environments. Here I contribute my expertise in web development and AI integration to create a modern, user-friendly platform.

## Tech Stack (or: What I Play With)

```yaml

  - Custom LLM Integration
  - Prompt Engineering

desktop:
  - Linux (of course!)
  - GNOME with customizations
  - Terminal > GUI
```

## Philosophy & Principles

**Code is like jazz** ‚Äì it needs structure, but also improvisation. My principles:

- üßπ **Clean Code**: Readable today = maintainable tomorrow
- üîì **Open Source First**: Knowledge should be shared, not hoarded
- üìö **Lifelong Learning**: Learn something new every day (today: more about LCARS design)
- üîê **Privacy by Design**: Privacy is not optional, it's standard
- üöÄ **Ship Fast, Iterate Faster**: Perfect is the enemy of done
- ‚òï **Coffee-Driven Development**: `while(awake) { code(); coffee(); }`

## When I'm Not Coding

**Rhine Swimming** üåä
Summer tradition in Basel: pack the Wickelfisch, jump in, drift comfortably downstream. Meditation for nerds.

**Linux & Open Source** üêß
I constantly test new distros (Arch user BTW... just kidding, I use Ubuntu), configure GNOME to perfection, and read release notes like other people read novels.

**Tech Blogging** ‚úçÔ∏è
I write about my experiences, failures, and successes. Because: shared knowledge = doubled knowledge.

**Star Trek & Sci-Fi** üññ
LCARS interfaces, warp drives, replicators ‚Äì the future I wish for. Make it so!

**Mastodon Instead of Twitter** üêò
Decentralized, open source, community-driven. That's how social media should be.

**Exploring Basel** üèôÔ∏è
Fasnacht, Autumn Fair, Rhine riverbanks ‚Äì Basel is more than just a location, it's a lifestyle.

## Fun Facts About Me

- I can operate `vim` (and get out again!)
- My ideal vacation: A Linux laptop, good coffee, and a tech project
- I read other people's git commit messages for fun
- My browser has an average of 47 tabs open (minimum)
- I enjoy discussing tabs vs. spaces (Team Spaces, sorry not sorry)
- Star Trek TNG > all other Star Trek series (fight me)

## Let's Connect! ü§ù

I'm always open to:

- **Exciting Projects** ‚Äì especially when it gets technically interesting
- **Tech Talks** ‚Äì about AI, web development, Linux, or why LCARS is the best UI design ever
- **Collaborations** ‚Äì open source thrives on cooperation
- **Coffee & Code** ‚Äì in Basel or remote

**Contact**: Write to me via the [contact page](/contact.php) or directly on [Mastodon](https://swiss.social/@srueegger).
